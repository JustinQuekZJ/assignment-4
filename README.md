This is a repo of code for a simple interactive webmap that aims to serve as a crime and safety dashboard/tool for NYC residents. As a police officer from Singapore, I wanted to try to build something related to law enforcement and public safety.

Currently, the map has two very basic functions: 1) Users can click on each precinct to view the NYPD station within that precinct; and 2) Users can input their location in the search function, and a route will be displayed from their current location to the NYPD station in that precinct.

I aim to build on the current code to add additional functionalities, for example, a layer that displays statistics like population statistics, arrest rates, police stop rates, and crime rates when users hover over each precinct.
